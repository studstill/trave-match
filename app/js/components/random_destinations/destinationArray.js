Originally an agricultural town, today the cultivation of the mind is Columbia\'s chief economic concern. Never a major center of manufacturing, the city also depends on healthcare, insurance, and technology businesses. Several companies—Shelter Insurance, Carfax, and Slackers CDs and Games among them—were founded in the city. Cultural institutions include the State Historical Society of Missouri, the Museum of Art and Archaeology, and the annual True/False Film Festival.
